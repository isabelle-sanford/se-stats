# to do

Make tables able to output as CSV as well as insertion

format appropriate words on se.html as typewriter text

Optional: set up sftp

grab another copy of data test to get rid of random middle empty rows

grab another copy of game test once more info is in fron striker & co

make git repo (if possible >>)

update dbd diagram

SIGH okay alignment/death/etc should have numerical PKs because chars could change

-- CREATE INDEX [name] ON [table]
-- opt:USING [method]
-- ([column] ASC NULLS FIRST) -- or DESC, NULLS LAST

-- method can be hash, btree, gist, ...
-- DROP INDEX name; or DROP INDEX IF EXISTS name;
