poke wilson about complexity stuff etc

pickle (or just import CSV) for each table at end of game_cleaning & table_splitting into a new notebook which puts tables into SQL form (Y -> true, NaN -> null, put IDs in playergame), then use those to insert into actual SQL table 

figure out how the heck to do this in mongo

add more constraints on table creation, esp. uniqueness, not null, 


make materialized views 


QS:
- if you tie something to a FK can it be null? 



Indices...
- Sparse index for each year in PG / games? dunno, not super helpful unless year is there somewhere


mongo

Collection 1 - games 
{
    _id: premade,
    game_id: 1,
    game_format: LG
    game_num: 11,
}
