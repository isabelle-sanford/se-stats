grab another copy of data test to get rid of random middle empty rows 

grab another copy of game test once more info is in fron striker & co
poke wilson about complexity stuff etc

pickle (or just import CSV) for each table at end of game_cleaning & table_splitting into a new notebook which puts tables into SQL form (Y -> true, NaN -> null, put IDs in playergame), then use those to insert into actual SQL table 

figure out how the heck to do this in mongo

add more constraints on table creation, esp. uniqueness, not null, 


make materialized views 


QS:
- if you tie something to a FK can it be null? 



Indices...
- Sparse index for each year in PG / games? dunno, not super helpful unless year is there somewhere


mongo

Collection 1 - games 
{
    _id: premade,
    game_id: 1,
    game_format: LG
    game_num: 11,
}




figure out why the hell game ID is being turned into a float on merging
and possibly other IDs




### Problems with game 
* Missing columns: 
    - Game format & number (could pull in from pg, should put in sheet)
    - Mech and dist balance (not yet in sheet; just make all null? )
    - IM id (pull from pg)
    - anon_num (currently boolean)
    - start and end date (not yet in sheet)
    - link (not in sheet in a helpful way)
* Type problems: 
    - num_posts is a float (??)

### Problems with playergame 
* Type problems: 
    - first, last, and num hits are all floats and should be ints
    - win should be nullable boolean
    - ids for game, alignment, and death should be ints
    - inactive is Y/blank rather than t/f
* pinchhitter doesn't exist

### Where to check for bad characters:
* game.title 
* player.player_name
* game.fundamentals?

### Other
* PG needs to be cleaned to remove things not in death / alignment tables; want to be able to do constraints also on complexity / etc 


What is the standard deviation between players in elim %?
Does the sheet have general role info? I'd be curious whether games with vote manip have a bias toward one team or the other
What is the total number of surviving eliminators?
Average number of surviving eliminators for games where the eliminators win would be interesting
