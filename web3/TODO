# TO DO

## actually for hw

MONGO

## Data

- actually get links from sheet
- WHY DOES EVERY GAME STRING HAVE A BUNCH OF TRAILING SPACES
- Have single-word alignemnt and survival descriptions

## Input

- Selects on single pages should be easier to find someone (type start? Provide small set of links to top X players?)

## Node / get / etc

- fetch view for mustache from file not from fucking huge string
- either do the other thing to sort tables or make sure sorting utility has access to table data (for single game things)
- replicate all Get stuff for single_player
- ideally put makeTable etc somewhere other than se_node??

## Aesthetics

- Navbar: make the right link show as active on the right page
- Figure out way to CSS tables without accidental effects

## etc

- Convert to Typescript

Games tables (fulldata and single player) should include GM list
find a decent url name for one_game and one_player
interdependent links to players/games on tables on each page
gracefully fail when no results show up
AESTHETICS:
More bolding lots of places
figure out a better way to show win/loss?
Make accessible to mobile (SE users! )
In singular game/player - make it easier to find a specific thing without scrolling 200 things. Maybe typeable thingy?
make sorting go both ways
sort by chronology
more / better summary stats
sorting does NOT do well with nulls-or-whatever (in hits cols)
Toggler button on small screens is yiikes
With templates - take navbar, footer, etc elsewhere? 

Add checks for BT, AG

Make actual about page for footer
