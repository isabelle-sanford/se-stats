Note: this is REAL ROUGH and I apologize. Hopefully you don't see this because I'll have resubmitted; I'm submitting what I have and then making it pretty in the morning. 


FILE LIST:

    table_making.sql  --  DDL SQL file making all tables & indices 

    data_cleaning.ipynb -- jupyter notebook taking my data from the original CSVs from the google sheet and putting it into SQL. Divided into three parts: basic cleaning (duplicated in mongo_making.ipynb / should probably be taken out), transformation into the appropriate tables (approximately equivalent to the CSVs submitted for hw3), and actual insertion. 

    mongo_making.ipynb -- jupyter notebook taking my data from the original CSVs from the google sheet and putting it into mongo. Divided into three (much, much smaller) parts: basic cleaning as before, making dicts in python, and insertion into mongo. 

    report.pdf -- part 1, diagrams and descriptions of the table/collection structures and why they're like that. part 2, query description

    queries.sql -- SQL queries. Described in part 2 but comments are probably clear enough

    queries.js -- Mongo queries.
