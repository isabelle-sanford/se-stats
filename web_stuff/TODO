gracefully fail when no results show up 
make singular pages via GET so you can link to a specific person/game
AESTHETICS:
    Navbar - not just even spacing like that 
    More bolding lots of places
    Full data - headers for each input are ehhhhh
    figure out a better way to show win/loss? 
In singular game/player - make it easier to find a specific thing without scrolling 200 things. Maybe typeable thingy?
make sorting go both ways
sort by chronology
put link to games on click in player GM games list


WITH DATA:
    make alignment descriptions that are a word or two >> same with survival


NOT before presentation:
    more / better summary stats
    sorting does NOT do well with nulls-or-whatever (in hits cols)
    Toggler button on small screens is yiikes
