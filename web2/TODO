# TO DO

## Data

- actually get links from sheet
- WHY DOES EVERY GAME STRING HAVE A BUNCH OF TRAILING SPACES

## Input

- Selects on single pages should be easier to find someone (type start? Provide small set of links to top X players?)

## Node / get / etc

- fetch view for mustache from file not from fucking huge string 
- either do the other thing to sort tables or make sure sorting utility has access to table data (for single game things)
- replicate all Get stuff for single_player
- ideally put makeTable etc somewhere other than se_node??

## Aesthetics

- Navbar: make the right link show as active on the right page

## etc

gracefully fail when no results show up
make singular pages via GET so you can link to a specific person/game
AESTHETICS:
Navbar - not just even spacing like that
More bolding lots of places
Full data - headers for each input are ehhhhh
figure out a better way to show win/loss?
Make accessible to mobile (SE users! )
In singular game/player - make it easier to find a specific thing without scrolling 200 things. Maybe typeable thingy?
make sorting go both ways
sort by chronology
put link to games on click in player GM games list

WITH DATA:
make alignment descriptions that are a word or two >> same with survival

NOT before presentation:
more / better summary stats
sorting does NOT do well with nulls-or-whatever (in hits cols)
Toggler button on small screens is yiikes

Add checks for BT, AG

Make actual about page for footer
