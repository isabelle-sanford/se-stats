    <h1>Sanderson Elimination Data</h1>

    <h2>Source/Explanation</h2>
    The data below is pulled from <a

        spreadsheet</a>, which records the statistics for the games on the <a
        href="https://www.17thshard.com/forum/forum/62-sanderson-elimination/">Sanderson Elimination</a> subforum. It
    was specifically pulled from the "Data Test" tab of the sheet on Feb 16, 2022.

    <h2>In-depth table descriptions</h2>
    <h3>player</h3>
    Player stores a simple integer/string pair for each unique player who has ever played (or run) a game in SE.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>player_id</strong>: integer representing a particular player.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>player_name</strong>: string representing that player's actual username (or occasionally nickname).
            In several tables below where <strong>player_id</strong> is used, this column stil appears alongside it,
            mostly
            because I know names and not IDs; those may be removed once tables are fully cleaned and ready to be worked
            with.
        </li>
        <li>
            May optionally include more stats here, but they'd mostly be summaries/statistics drawn from the playergame
            table.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>game</h3>
    Game is the primary table for providing information about each game. Games are usually referred to as XX#, e.g. LG17
    is the 17th game in the LG (Long Game) format. Asterisks indicate columns which do not currently
    exist or do not have any data in them right now. Many columns are only partially filled out; that will hopefully be
    fixed soon.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>game_id</strong>: integer representing the particular game
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>format</strong>: two characters representing the game format. Options are LG (Long Game), MR (Mid
            Range), QF (Quick Fix), BT (Break Tank), or AG (Anniversary Game, a subset of LG).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>game_num</strong>: double representing which number in the format the game is. (It's a double
            because a few games accidentally end the first turn for some reason and are rerun immediately, in which case
            they're denoted as XX.1 and XX.2 - or sometimes XXa and XXb, but double is more convenient I think.)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>game_string</strong>: This may or may not be taken out eventually as it represents redundant
            information: it's 4-ish characters combining <strong>format</strong> and <strong>game_num</strong> into a
            string that's the common way we refer to games, e.g. my first game was LG15. This column is also included in
            other tables which include <strong>game_id</strong>, because it's a more helpful reference than a random
            integer, but those will probably be taken out eventually. (Not sure yet; integer seems better but when I
            look at a game string I know what it means without having to look it up in a table and the strings
            <i>are</i> unique.)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>is_anon*</strong>: boolean representing whether the game was anonymous or not. (Occasionally we play
            'anonymous' games wherein each player gets access to one of the special accounts made for this purpose and
            they play without revealing their usual identity/username.)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>broken</strong>: Character? String? Number? Something representing whether the game was broken and
            in what way. (Currently in game.csv there's an is_broken column which is "Y" or nothing (and will definitely
            at least be made a boolean), and a different (much less filled out) column which specifies in what way it's
            broken.) Options are Well Balanced, Fairly Balanced, Broken from Mechanics, Very Broken from Mechanics,
            Broken from Distribution, Broken from Mechanics and Distribution. (May have a separate key table for this
            column.)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>IM_id</strong>: integer representing the player_id of the Impartial Moderator for that game. (There
            are 3-5 moderators of the subforum at any given time, and for each game one of them must watch the game,
            provide advice and help the GM with any problems that arise.)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>start_date*</strong> and <strong>end_date*</strong>: Dates representing the day (in uhh some time
            zone) on which the game started and ended. (Generally these are in the range of 1-8 weeks apart.)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>num_cycles</strong>: Number of cycles from start to end that a game had. (This just records the
            cycle number immediately previous to game end; day/night separation vs not isn't considered.)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>is_sanderson*</strong>: boolean representing whether the setting of the game was Sanderson or not.
            (Each game has a 'flavor' / setting which determines the names of the roles/teams, and players can roleplay
            as a character in that setting, and if they die the GM will describe each character's death in detail when
            announcing who died. (I have written literally hundreds of deaths because of this.) The forum on which we
            play is a fan site for the author Brandon Sanderson, so there are certain restrictions on when you can run
            games which have a non-Sanderson setting. Currently there's instead a <strong>setting</strong> column which
            specifies a string that includes whether something is non-sanderson or not.)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>world*</strong>: string?? representing which world a particular game took place on (i.e. basically
            which book series is being drawn on for the flavor). Probably only
            filled if is_sanderson is true? (could also have an additional location
            column that's more specific)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>complexity</strong>: number(??) representing how complex the game was. (may also break out a key
            table for this) Current options are Basic, Standard, Semi Standard,
            Complex, and Faction/Free-for-all.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>fundamentals</strong>: Short string(?) representing what type of game it was. Options are V/E
            ("standard" village/elim), Multiple E (multiple elim teams), Conversion (elims start as usually-1-person who
            converts others), Faction (no evil/good distinction between teams), FFA (free for all: only one person can
            win), or Unique.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>num_posts</strong>: Number of posts in the relevant game thread overall.
        </li>
        <li>
            Other things that might be added: a link to the actual game thread [note to self: will be tricky for LG37,
            but probs just link main thread?], a column indicating who won the game. (This is currently present in the
            game.csv table as <strong>winner</strong>, but it is technically redundant to player_game and in fact loses
            information from that since multiple teams might win in some cases and only one will be listed here.)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- TODO remember to include note about currently having name/game strings -->

    <h3>gm</h3>
    This table lists the GM(s), or Game Master(s), who ran each game. Often a game is run with two or three people, one
    of whom may be the "primary" GM and the others are helpers.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>gm_id</strong>: integer representing the player_id of the GM.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>game_id</strong>: integer representing the game_id of the game this person GMed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>is_main</strong>: boolean representing whether this person was the primary GM of this game or not.
            (There may be multiple primary GMs for a single game.)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>playergame</h3>
    This is the "primary" table which holds by far the most data. Each row has a unique player_id/game_id pair, which
    represents what happened to that player in that game.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>player_id</strong>: integer representing a particular player (from the player table).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>game_id</strong>: integer representing the game_id of the game in question.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>alignment_id</strong>: character representing what alignment (good, evil, neutral, etc) the player
            was. References the alignment table.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>death_id</strong>: character representing what happened to the player that game (survived, killed by
            elims, dropped out, etc). References the death table.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>first_hit</strong> and <strong>last_hit</strong> integers representing the cycles on which a player
            first and last took a hit. [reminder about how it's the cycle hit NOT announced] Data is absent for some
            games.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>num_hits</strong>: integer representing the number of hits a player took over the course of a game.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>win</strong>: nullable boolean representing whether the player won (true), lost (false), or drew
            (null; this happens rarely but it does happen).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>pinchhitter*</strong>: boolean representing whether this player stepped in for someone else. (Or
            maybe was-stepped-in-for?) Helpful especially for accurately counting the number of players in a game.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>inactive</strong>: character representing whether the player went inactive or not. (kinda
            subjective, and depends on whether the player warned anyone beforehand)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>alignment</h3>
    This table is basically a "key" that describes what each character in the alignment column of playergame means.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>alignment_id</strong>: character representing a unique alignment.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>alignment_name</strong>: short string describing what that character stands for.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>is_elim*</strong>: boolean representing whether this alignment is a type of eliminator (since there
            are several).
        </li>
        <li>
            Optionally other booleans to make the division make more sense like is_converter, was_converted (or maybe
            put that as a separate bool in playergame?), and has_kill.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>death</h3>
    This table is basically a "key" that describes what each character in the death column of playergame means.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>death_id</strong>: character representing a unique death type (killed by eliminators, by execution,
            by a neutral, etc).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>game_id</strong>: short description (usually a word) describing what that character represents.
        </li>
        <li>
            Optionally booleans like killed_by_village (for F vs V), or maybe just stick that in playergame and have a
            single thing for night kills.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Table relations</h2>
    Each player and each game has a unique integer ID, which are stored along with associated information in the player
    and game tables respectively as primary keys. The game_id is used in playergame and gm, also as game_id. Player IDs
    are used anywhere a player is referred to, which includes IM_id in game (for the Impartial Moderator) and gm_id in
    gm (for the Game Master in question). The alignment and death tables are both essentially legends or keys that
    provide more description/information about the values in the corresponding columns in playergame. The "main" table
    here is playergame, which contains a single row for each player in each game, including whether they were
    good/evil/etc, what happened to them, when it happened, and what role they had.
